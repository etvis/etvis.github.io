ACM's TRANSITION TO FULL OPEN ACCESS
_____________________________________
** Important update on ACM's new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences! **

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. 
All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. 
Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). 
With over 2,600 institutions already part of ACM Open, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences (currently, around 76%).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial waiver. 
To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-discretionary-open-access-apc-waivers.  
Keep in mind that waivers are rare and are granted based on specific criteria set by ACM.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. 
The subsidy will offer:

● $250 APC for ACM/SIG members
● $350 for non-members

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. 
Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period.
This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026.

SCOPE
______
Broadly, this workshop considers the intersection of eye tracking research with visualization, whether the contributions relate to eye tracking studies of visualizations, or vice versa, visualization techniques for eye tracking.
Technological advances in computer vision algorithms and sensor hardware have greatly reduced the implementational and financial costs of eye tracking. 
Thus, it is unsurprising to witness a significant increase in its use as a research tool in fields beyond the traditional domains of biological vision, 
psychology, and neuroscience, in particular, in visualization and human-computer interaction research. 
One of the key challenges lies in the analysis, interaction, and visualization of complex spatio-temporal datasets of gaze behavior, which is further 
complicated by complementary datasets such as semantic labels, user interactions and/or accompanying physiological sensor recordings. 
Ultimately, the research objective is to allow eye tracking data to be effectively interpreted in terms of the observer’s decision-making and cognitive processes. 
To achieve this, it is necessary to draw upon our current understanding of gaze-behavior across various and related fields, from vision and cognition to visualization. 
Altogether, eye tracking is an important field to be understood, be it in the sense of data analysis and visualization, interaction, or user-based evaluation of visualization.

_______
TOPICS
_______
Manuscripts are solicited on the following topics with an emphasis on the relationship between eye tracking and visualization, including but not limited to the following:

•   Visualization and visual analytics techniques for eye movement data
•   Eye movement data analysis, visual data mining, aggregation, clustering, and metrics for eye movement data
•   Eye movement data provenance, big eye movement data
•   Uncertainty visualization of gaze data
•   Standardized metrics for evaluating interactions with visualization
•   Novel methods for eye-tracking in challenging visualization scenarios
•   Interactive annotation of gaze and stimulus data
•   Systems for visual exploration of eye movement data
•   Reports of eye tracking studies evaluating visualization or visual analytics
•   Eye tracking in non-WIMP visualization environments, including mobile eye tracking, mobile devices, virtual environments, mixed reality, and large displays
•   Eye tracking-based interaction techniques for visualization
•   Interpreting eye movement scanpaths from the perspective of human cognitive architecture and perceptuo-motor expertise
•   Perception in eye tracking studies
•   Evaluation of cartographic and other spatial visualizations with eye tracking
•   Inferences that can be drawn from gaze behavior
•   Cognitive models for inferring user states from gaze behavior with visualizations
•   Applications that rely on eye-tracking as an adaptive input parameter
•   Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with a focus on eye tracking

____________
SUBMISSIONS
____________
Authors are invited to submit original work complying with the ETRA SHORT PAPER format (up to 8 pages in single-column format, any number of references, max. 150 words abstract).
Also, ensure that the Author Guidelines (https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors for SIG sponsored events [sigconf]) are met prior to submission.
** New this year ** Please read and follow the ACM Policy on Authorship (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies in ACM published Work.
