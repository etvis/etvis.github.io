SCOPE
______
Broadly, this workshop considers the intersection of eye tracking research with visualization, whether the contributions relate to eye tracking studies 
of visualizations, or vice versa, visualization techniques for eye tracking.
Technological advances in computer vision algorithms and sensor hardware have greatly reduced the implementational and financial costs of eye tracking. 
Thus, it is unsurprising to witness a significant increase in its use as a research tool in fields beyond the traditional domains of biological vision, 
psychology, and neuroscience, in particular, in visualization and human-computer interaction research. 
One of the key challenges lies in the analysis, interaction, and visualization of complex spatio-temporal datasets of gaze behavior, which is further 
complicated by complementary datasets such as semantic labels, user interactions and/or accompanying physiological sensor recordings. 
Ultimately, the research objective is to allow eye tracking data to be effectively interpreted in terms of the observer’s decision-making and cognitive processes. 
To achieve this, it is necessary to draw upon our current understanding of gaze-behavior across various and related fields, from vision and cognition to visualization. 
All together eye tracking is an important field to be understood, be it in the sense of data analysis and visualization, interaction, or user-based evaluation of visualization.

_______
TOPICS
_______
Manuscripts are solicited on the following topics with an emphasis on the relationship between eye tracking and visualization, including but not limited to the following:

●       Visualization techniques for eye-movement data (inc. spatio-temporal visualization, evolution of gaze patterns, visual analysis of individual behavior, 2D vs. 3D representations of eye-movement data)
●       Visual analytics of gaze behavior (inc. visual data mining, aggregation, clustering techniques, and metrics for eye-movement data)
●       Eye-movement data provenance
●       Standardized metrics for evaluating gaze interactions with visualization
●       Cognitive models for gaze interactions with visualizations
●       Novel methods for eye tracking in challenging visualization scenarios
●       Uncertainty visualization of gaze data
●       Interactive annotation of gaze and stimulus data
●       Systems for the visual exploration of eye-movement data
●       Eye tracking studies that evaluate visualization or visual analytics
●       Eye tracking in non-WIMP visualization environments, including mobile eye tracking, mobile devices, and large displays
●       Visualization of eye tracking data in mixed and virtual reality (3df & 6df, 360°)
●       Visualization applications that rely on eye tracking as an input parameter

____________
